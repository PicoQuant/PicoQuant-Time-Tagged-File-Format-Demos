MainPTUdemo.vi / MainPHUdemo.vi is a demo that reads a PTU / PHU file 
and dumps its contents in an ASCII file. Note that this is not meant to 
be a conversion tool. 
You are encouraged to modify it for immediate processing of the data
according to whatever your application actually requires.
Conversion to ASCII is silly because it massively increases the file 
size and does not get you closer to the ultimate goal of somehow 
meaningfully processing the data.

MainTagBrowser.vi is a generic little demo that reads the header of
any kind of PicoQUant's tagged files (*.pco;*.pfs;*.phu;*.pqres;*.ptu;*.pus)
and lets you browse the header items. Payload data beyond the header will 
not be shown.

Common.llb is a library that provides sub-vis shared by the demos.
