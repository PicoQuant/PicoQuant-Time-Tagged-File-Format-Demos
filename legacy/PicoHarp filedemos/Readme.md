PicoHarp 300 TCSPC Software 

This folder contains demo programs (incl source code) for reading
PicoHarp data files. These are DEMOS. They are not designed to routinely 
convert PicoHarp files to ASCII. This would in most cases be inefficient 
and of little practical value. The objective is to enable users to write 
their own file reading and analysis programs.
Note that the file format version is not the same as the software version.
For instance, software version 2.3 writes file format version 2.0.
Newer software versions can usually read older format versions while the 
opposite is usually not true.
