This folder contains demo programs (incl source code) for reading
.PTU and .PHU data files. These are DEMOS. They are not designed to 
routinely convert these files to ASCII. This would in most cases be 
inefficient and of little practical value. The objective is to enable 
users to write their own file reading and analysis programs.
For format documentation please see the folder [doc].
